How about
----

[ ] Slow down the space ship, there is no need for such speed
[ ] Destroyable asteroids floating around
[ ] Persistence
    [ ] Ship / Inventory / Player
    [ ] World 
[ ] Start off with no shield, small health

[ ] Resources to collect
    [ ] Metal(s)
    [ ] Rock
    [ ] Bio matter
    [ ] Gases
[ ] Structures to create
    [ ] Space port

[ ] Automatable shit, no farming.
[ ] Automatable shit, defence.

Could we do hybrid RTS? 
  - State how many players you want
  - Wait for players to join
  - Spawn across the 'map' from each other
  - Randomised resources/etc distributed across the map
  - Randomised things to shoot at other than the other player (maybe)
  - Fly around shooty shooty
  - Fly around buildy buildy
  - Minimap with alerts when fighty fighty
  - Respawn back at base so long as spawner still exists


-- Tech

[ ] Move ev into a Variant
[ ] Move most components outside of 'game'
[ ] Generify the networking aspect of this
[ ] Generify the rendering aspect of this

[ ] Newtypes for Game/Player... 
[ ] Ticks should really be a type
[ ] Break up LocalContext
[ ] Just sort out main.purs on the client in general :S :S :S
[ ] Probably need to spin up the game itself in a spawnProcess on the server to avoid blocking
[ ] Show loading screen whilst pre-loading assets on client
[ ] Need to profile the hot loop, probably benefits to be had by unpacking the records

-- Entirely unnecessary stuff

[ ] Infinite background (load/render on demand (yawn))
[ ] Shaders/layers
[ ] Proper collision 
[ ] Asteroids
[x] Might want to move health/shield data into the state of the component itself, but then we'd need a way to get it out...
