How about
----

[ ] Slow down the space ship, there is no need for such speed
[ ] Destroyable asteroids floating around
[ ] Inventory (Can just do this in HTML..)
[ ] Persistence
    [ ] Ship / Inventory / Player
    [ ] World 

[ ] Start off with no shield, small health
[ ] Planets / Suns / Etc (Representative, gravity wells?)
[ ] Resources to collect
    [ ] Metal(s)
    [ ] Rock
    [ ] Bio matter
    [ ] Gases
[ ] Structures to create
    [ ] Space port

[ ] Automatable shit, no farming.


-- Features

[x] Pings need sending from client/server every second
[x] Deal with players disconnecting (10 second timeout)
[x] Deal with players (re) connecting
[x] Display game URL in UI
[x] Display player info in UI
[x] Send (valid) events to clients for processing
[x] Ignore our own messages when they come back to us
[x] Rubberbanding (simple lerp)
[/] Delay processing commands by [latency]
[/] Handle disconection as client (either server rejection or socket gone pop) (I think)
[x] Ticks (especially on server side) need to be adjusted for elapsed time
[ ] Use shared clock/ticks to attempt to make commands happen at the same time server/client

[ ] Rendering needs to be function rather than straight up scene graph
  - Issue with this: Game is server/client and 'canvas' doesn't exist on the server
[x] Bullets needs to be a single entity rendering all the bullets
[x] Bullets can then send commands to entities to let them know they've been damaged..

[x] Move player mgmt logic into game itself
[x] Ship destruction means points
[x] Ship destruction means respawn required
[x] Need to find a psuedo-random generator actually written in Purescript.. (no Effect)
[x] Player death need to tell the player they died
[x] Player death need to show a countdown to player
[x] Player death would be nice to animate the camera zoom/roll 
[x] Will need to differentiate between player destruction/asteroid/other

[x] Display ship health to player whose ship it is
[x] Ship has regenerable shield (prolonged attack required to destroy)

[x] Display the shield 

[x] suspend+terminate unused games
[x] When a game doesn't exist anymore, player needs booting to the lobby
[x] Graceful disconnect
[x] Need to discover the base url to connect to..

[ ] Player name != Player Id
[ ] Show player names next to ships

[x] Bullets need to not inherit ship speed
[ ] Bullets should come in bursts, more likely to hit other players that way
[ ] Ideally bullets are smaller, and double barrelled from the guns on the ship
[ ] Afterburner trail/animation :)
[ ] Sounds (just buy an effects lib)

[ ] Fullscreen canvas, UI overlayed on top
[ ] Mobile input/controls
[ ] Test on iphone
[ ] Release process (systemd package, etc)

[ ] List public games in UI for easy selection
[ ] Auth (bare minimum, preferably no data needed)
[ ] Encrypted cookie for telling who somebody is
[ ] Admin UI (view games / players / latency / etc)
[ ] Write some tests for game behaviour when nobody is watching
[ ] Shitty chat window so we can hurl abuse when dead (RTC chat should really be done but meh)
[ ] Probably need different types for the initial sync (shield/health/etc) vs incremental (shouldn't need those things)
[ ] Distributed setup (worker nodes, erlang comms - unnecessary, but example of how to do this in Purerl..)
[ ] Opentelemetry integration 


[ ] Collision + network sync requires some thought as it drifts a lot

-- Power-ups

[ ] Health gain
[ ] Shield restore
[ ] Speed boost
[ ] Radar
[ ] Scatter shot

===========================

-- Possible Game Play Idea #1

[ ] Collect resources..
[ ] Grow in size 
[ ] Health++ as you grow
[ ] Speed++ as you grow
[ ] Power++ as you grow

The idea being that big ships attack other big ships, it'll be hard to aim at small ships if you're a big ship

-- Possible Game Play Idea #2

- Capture the flag/area
- Points awarded for staying alive in a specific region of space



The idea being that big ships attack other big ships, it'll be hard to aim at small ships if you're a big ship

===========================

-- Code

[ ] Newtypes for Game/Player... 
[ ] Ticks should really be a type
[ ] Break up LocalContext
[ ] Just sort out main.purs on the client in general :S :S :S
[ ] Probably need to spin up the game itself in a spawnProcess on the server to avoid blocking
[ ] Show loading screen whilst pre-loading assets on client
[ ] Need to profile the hot loop, probably benefits to be had by unpacking the records

-- Entirely unnecessary stuff

[ ] Infinite background (load/render on demand (yawn))
[ ] Shaders/layers
[ ] Proper collision 
[ ] Asteroids
[ ] Might want to move health/shield data into the state of the component itself, but then we'd need a way to get it out...
