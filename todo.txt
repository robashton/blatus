How about

[x] On 'game creation', generate a map in some 'bounds'
  [x] Asteroids
  [ ] Gas clouds
  [ ] Structures (space stationy bits whatever)

-- Issues --
--        --

[x] Starfield pls
[x] Work out what's going on with the dodgy collision sync
[x] Need more info on the 'sync' object so we can have different sizes asteroids
[ ] we've got a disconnection problem happening after a timeout despite pings taking place
[ ] Don't spawn the player ship until the first sync has been received
[ ] Don't allow leaving of the 'bounds'
[ ] Visual indication of the 'bounds'

[ ] Need a boost mechanism to spice up the speed a little
[ ] We need to add a debug console to adjust things 'live'
      - Change values in client
      - Change values on server :/
      - Server needs to validate, maybe they're just special 'events' (DebugEvent)
[ ] Think about perhaps interpolating bullet-spread if the ship is rotating when firing
    - Or bring back auto-targeting/lock ala hoverbattles (!!)

[ ] Game workflow 
  - Create new game (how many players)
  - Public?
  - Get the URL, give it to pals (or wait for people otherwise)
  - Once enough people joined, 5 second countdown and go..

[x] Slow down the space ship, there is no need for such speed
Start off with no shield, small health

Resources to collect
 Metal(s)
 Rock
 Bio matter
 Gases
Structures to create
  Space port

Automatable shit, no farming.
Automatable shit, defence.

Could we do hybrid RTS? 
  - State how many players you want
  - Wait for players to join
  - Spawn across the 'map' from each other
  - Randomised resources/etc distributed across the map
  - Randomised things to shoot at other than the other player (maybe)
  - Fly around shooty shooty
  - Fly around buildy buildy
  - Minimap with alerts when fighty fighty
  - Respawn back at base so long as spawner still exists


-- Tech

[x] Move ev into a Variant
[x] Sort out the namespaces again
[x] Move most components outside of 'game'
[ ] Generify the networking aspect of this
[ ] Generify the rendering aspect of this
[ ] Newtypes for width/height
[ ] Newtypes for Game/Player... 
[ ] Newtype for game names
[ ] Purge wrap/unwrap
[ ] Ticks should really be a type
[ ] Break up LocalContext
[ ] Just sort out main.purs on the client in general :S :S :S
[ ] Probably need to spin up the game itself in a spawnProcess on the server to avoid blocking
[ ] Show loading screen whilst pre-loading assets on client
[ ] Need to profile the hot loop, probably benefits to be had by unpacking the records

-- Entirely unnecessary stuff

[ ] Infinite background (load/render on demand (yawn))
[ ] Shaders/layers
[ ] Proper collision 
[ ] Asteroids
[x] Might want to move health/shield data into the state of the component itself, but then we'd need a way to get it out...
